In a transverse  stationary wave on a                         string, when the particle passes  their                         mean    position,  their  velocity  is                         maximum. Since, all particles pass their                         mean positions simultaneously, the string                         becomes straight when the kinetic energy                         is maximum.                     25.

The centre of mass will not move, because                         there is no external force. There is a force                         of mutual attraction under which centre                         of mass will not shift.                         Hence, speed of centre of mass is zero.","Mock  Test–1 Solutions (Physics)                      39.
